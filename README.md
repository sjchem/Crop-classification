# Crop-classification
This project implements a deep learningâ€“based crop classification model trained on the Popular 139 Crops Image Dataset. The dataset covers 139 widely cultivated crop types, each with around 250 images, making it a valuable resource for agricultural AI, plant recognition, and automated crop monitoring.

The model aims to accurately classify crop species from images, supporting applications in precision farming, automated plant identification, and agricultural research
